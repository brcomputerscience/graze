## Getting Started

To start using Graze, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/graze.git

2. Open the project directory:

    ```bash

## Usage
For Newbies
If you're new to web development or just want to use the application, here's a simple guide:

Open the file uploader by following the "Getting Started" steps.

1. You'll see an input field labeled "Upload." Enter your files here. For example, you can upload dhruvrakhadeforpresident.png to get a stunning image of Dhruv!
2. Press the "Graph" button, and the graph will appear on the canvas.

Experiment with different files and see how the database changes in real-time.

## Customization
Experienced developers may want to customize the project further. You can modify the code to change the appearance of the homepage, add additional features, or integrate it into other web applications.

- The Flask code for this project can be found in the app.py file. We also use jQuery for sleek JavaScript operations.

- The code listens for form submissions using jQuery. When the form is submitted, it retrieves the file from the user's computer, and uploads it into our safe and secure database.
